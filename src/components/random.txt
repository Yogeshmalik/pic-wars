the user can see the fetched data from the api and option to upload, view, delete, share images(including caption) uploaded images and its data is stored on firestore. Home button should be there at top of every page except the login page. Logout button should be there under every page(if the user is logged in). show user logged-in Name at the right top of header if the user is logged in. customize the buttons, red color should be for logout and delete, green color should be login and upload button, blue color should be Home button, Details and view photo should be yellow color buttons.
